# Jose Moncada - Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project provides an interactive dashboard to explore the **Belly Button Biodiversity** dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (Operational Taxonomic Units or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The goal of this dashboard is to allow users to interactively explore the data and see various visualizations such as a bar chart, bubble chart, and metadata information based on the sample selected.

## Features

- **Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 OTUs found in a selected sample.
- **Bubble Chart:** Shows the distribution of OTUs in a selected sample, with marker size and color representing the sample values and OTU IDs.
- **Metadata:** Displays demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) of an individual based on the sample selected.
- **Dynamic Interaction:** Updates all charts and metadata when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

## Deployment

The app is live and can be accessed through GitHub Pages:
